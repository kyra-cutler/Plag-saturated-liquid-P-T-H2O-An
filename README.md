# Plagioclase-saturated liquid hygrothermobarometry and plagioclase-liquid equilibria using machine learning 

These R scripts allow users to obtain estimates of pre-eruptive storage conditions (P-T-H2O-An) using plagioclase-saturated liquids. Users must have R (https://www.r-project.org/) and R studio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed to run the code, as well as have a version of Excel that can open .xlsx files.

To get started: 

1) Download the ‘plag-saturated-liquid-hygrothermobarometry’ folder. 

2) Enter your normalised glass compositional data into the INPUT.xlsx spreadsheet. All oxide columns must be filled or entered with zero. 

3) Open the P_T_H2O_An.R script
